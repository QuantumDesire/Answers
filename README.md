# 2017 Math Answer Keys

An ex-student who out smarted the IT guys. I am still able to access the school network and all resource drives even after having my lap top erased. 

I have managed to dig up the answer keys for Maths A and B. I thought I'd have some fun and upload them. If you are lucky enough to find this website, you know some smart people.

I guess you want to know how to get the files now, so here it is:

1. click the green "Clone or Download" button then "Download ZIP".
2. Unzip the "Answer-master.zip" and open the folder.
3. Then unzip the "Maths Answers.zip" and open it (This is where the good shit is).
